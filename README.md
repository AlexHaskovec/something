# Something

The program asks for your name and if you want it printed backwards, and then uses recursion to print the name backwards if the user chooses to do so.

## How to use:

This program requires python to run, we used python 3.7 so older versions may not be supported.

You need to enter your name when prompted, then enter a lowercase "y" if you do want your name printed backwards.

## Installation Documentation:

First make sure you have python installed on your computer, or that you have some other way of running a python program.
Next, download the-something.py and run it using your command line or your preferred method of executing pyhton programs

## Usage Documentation:

the-something.py takes in 2 inputs
the first should be a name
the second should be "y" if you want your name printed backwards
any other character will not print your name backwards

## How to contribute:

Just clone the project then create a new pull request on mrd104's repository on github

## Why we chose our license and code of conduct:

We used the unlicense license because we want our program to be used by anyone for any reason without restriction by copyright or anything like that. 
The code is simple enough that if anyone wants to use it then they should be able to with the least amount of restriction possible.

We chose our code of conduct because it lays out the terms of behavior very clearly. It lays a groundwork that supports marginalized people and takes a firm stand against inappropriate and unwelcoming behavior. Basically it's a very clear and verbose "don't be a dick."
